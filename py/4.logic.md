# Logic

## if elif else

There is no `else if` in python.

```py
x = 0
if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
    print('Single')
else:
    print('More')
```

## Ternary

It's not `? :`

```py
k = 2
x = 'a' if k == 3 else 'b'
```

## for

There is only one loop: `for ... in`. There are not loops like `for ... of` or `for(;;)`

You can loop through list, string.

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in fruits:
  print(x)

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```

There is `for ... else` statement. Things after `else:` is called when the loop is done. 

```py
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!") # Called when the loop is done.
```

When you want to run a loop for a set number of times. Use `range()`.

```py
for x in range(6): # 0~5
  print(x)

for x in range(2, 6): # 2~5
  print(x)

for x in range(2, 10, 3): #2,5,8
  print(x)
```

## while

```py
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

There is no `do ... while`. Use this below:

```py
while True:
  stuff()
  if fail_condition:
    break
```

## break continue

`break` and `continue` are same. You cannot break outer loop. You can do it with `for ... else` trick.

```py
# use the for-else syntax
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        if j == 2 and i == 0:
            break
    else:  # only execute when it's no break in the inner loop
        continue
    break
```

Maybe removing nested loop might be the solution.

```py
# Avoid nested loops
import itertools
for i, j in itertools.product(range(5), range(5)):
    if j == 2 and i == 0:
        break
```

## pass keyword

The body of `if`, `for`, `while` should not be empty. If it should, use `pass`.

```py
if x == 3:
    pass
```
