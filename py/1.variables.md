# Variables

## Comment

2 ways: # and """

```py
# comment : ctrl + /
```

```py
"""
This is multiline comment.
"""
```

## Variable

Assign it with `=`. Print the value with `print()`.

```py
x = 1; # ; is allowed but it's not recommended.
y = 2
print(x) # console.log() of JavaScript
print(x, y) # It's just like console.log().
```

## Constants

There is no `const` keyword. The closest equivalent one is `from typing import Final`. It allows reassignment, but it raises an error with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

```py
# credits to https://stackoverflow.com/a/2682752
from typing import Final

A: Final = 1 # conventinally, constants are written in CAPITAL LETTERS.

# Executes fine, but mypy will report an error if you run mypy on this:
A = 2
```

## Data types

Text Type:	`str`
Numeric Types:	`int`, `float`, `complex`
Sequence Types:	`list`, `tuple`, `range`
Mapping Type:	`dict`
Set Types:	`set`, `frozenset`
Boolean Type:	`bool`
Binary Types:	`bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

Check types with `type()` function.

```py
x = 42
print(type(x)) # -> int
```

## String

Strings can be inside both double quotes("") and single quotes('').

It's `str`, not `string`.

```py
x = "test string"
```

Strings can be concatenated with `+`.

```py
x = "test"
y = "123"
print(x+y)
```

Formatting: `format()` function or f-string.

```py
name = 'Harry Potter'
greeting = "Hello, {}".format(name)
greeting = f"Hello, {name}" # from 3.6
```

## Boolean

It's `True` and `False`, not `true` and `false`.

```py
x = true # Error!
x = True
```
