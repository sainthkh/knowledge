# Operators

## Arithmetic

`+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `**` `//`

```py
x = 11 / 3 # 3.6666
y = 11 // 3 # 3
```

## Assignment

Same. 

## Comparison

`==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=`

No `===`. Because `==` plays the role of `===`.

```py
f = 1 == '1' # False. It's not JavaScript.
```

## Logical

`and` `or` `not`.

```py
a = True
b = not a # It's not !a.
c = a and b # It's not a && b
d = b or c # It's not b || c
```

`and`, `or` can be used in assignment like JavaScript.

```py
a = None
b = a or 'string' # 'string'
c = b and 42 # 42
```

## Identity Operators

Check if compared objects have the same reference.

```py
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is z) # True
print(x is y) # False. Same value but different objects
print(x == y) # True. Different objects but have same value.
```

## Membership Operators

`in` and `not in`

```py
x = ["apple", "banana"]

print("banana" in x) # True
print("kiwi" not in x) # True
```

You can use it with dictionary, too.

```py
x = {'a':1, 'b':2}
print('a' in x) # True
```
